  <button>I want a Wales where, if I struggle with my mental health or experience emotional pain, I am asked “what happened to you?” not “what is wrong with you?”</button>
  <text>Carers Wales</text>
  <button>I want people who provide care on an unpaid basis to family or friends who are elderly, ill or disabled to be valued by society. I want them to receive support so they can provide care while looking after their own wellbeing</button>
  <text>Mind Cymru</text>
  <button>I want everyone experiencing a mental health problem in Wales to get the support and respect they deserve – particularly young people, people living in poverty and people from black and minority ethnic communities. I want an end to the stigma and discrimination faced by people with mental health problems so they can talk about mental health openly without fear</button>
