<h1>Vote for Your Values!</h1>
<h2>See which parties are promising on the things that matter to us. 
<br>
<br>
All the statements link to the seven areas of “wellbeing” defined in Welsh law, the <a href="https://www.futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/" target="_blank">Wellbeing of Future Genrations Act</a>. Whatever party wins the election, their government is
legally bound by this law.<br>
<br> 
Strong green economy<br>
Strong communities<br>
Good health<br>
Climate and nature restoration<br>
Thriving language and culture<br>
Equality and an end to discrimination<br>
Positive contribution to international affairs<br>

<br>

Every statement is written by or extracted from the website of a non-governmental
organisation that leads national action on the subject. Select the areas that mean the most to you. Then see what the party manifestos say in each of these areas. [The work of matching the statements below with manifesto commitments will be done with the Office of the Wellbeing Commissioner.] <br>
<br>
Choose your favourite manifesto promise and then you will see which party said what. That’s it!</p>
